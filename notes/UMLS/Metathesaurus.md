# Metathesaurus

## Source Vocabularies

Metathesaurus combines concepts from several source vocabularies(terminologies, classifications, and thesauri) and preserve the content and meaning from them.

## Concepts, Concept Names, and Their Identifiers

Metathesaurus assigns several types of unique, permanent identifiers to the concepts and concept names it contains, in addition to retaining all identifiers that are present in the source vocabularies.

**Concept and CUI: concept identifier**

Each concept or meaning in the Metathesaurus has a unique and permanent concept identifier (CUI).

**Concept Name and SUI: string identifier**

Each unique concept name or string in each language in the Metathesaurus has a unique and permanent string identifier (SUI). Any variation in character set, upper-lower case, or punctuation is a separate string, with a separate SUI. The same string in different languages (e.g., English and Spanish) will have a different string identifier for each language.



**Atoms and AUI: atom Identifiers**

Every occurrence of a string in each source vocabulary is assigned a unique atom identifier (AUI)



**Terms and LUI: lexical Identifiers**

For English language entries in the Metathesaurus only, each string is linked to all of its lexical variants or minor variations by means of a common term identifier (LUI). English lexical variants are detected using the Lexical Variant Generator (lvg) program, one of the UMLS [Lexical Tools](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/nlmumls/ch06/#ch06.The_SPECIALIST_Lexical_Tools)
