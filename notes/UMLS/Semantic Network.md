Goal

1. categorization of all concepts represented in the UMLS Metathesaurus

2. Semantic Relations between Semantic Types



## Overview

Nodes: semantic types in Metathesaurus

Edges: relationship between semantic types

*Connection between SN and Meta*: the most specific semantic type available is the semantic type of a concept in Meta



## Link types

1. primary link: isa. establish hierarchy of types.

2. non-hierarchical: 5 categories. "physically related to", "spatially related to", "temporally related to", "functionally related to", and "conceptually related to".
